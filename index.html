				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img id="photo_me" src="./assets/images/photo_me.jpg" title="forrest_photo">
				<p>
					My name is Forrest, and no, I'm not a big runner. I live in Austin, Texas, and am activitly growing my skills as a web developer. Thinking and building my ideas has been a passion of mine since I was a boy playing with Legos, and I have finally found an outlet where I can make my creativity a profession. The enjoyment from my work, along with the knowledge that I will always be growing and learning in this industry, gives me the fire to do my best each day.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Outside of being a developer, I love being outdoors and enjoying the beauty Texas has to offer. Most weekends I find myself hiking the greenbelt or at a lake or river around the city. Sports are also a huge passion of mine, my favorite teams being the Texas Longhorns and the San Antonio Spurs. I enjoy playing all sports as well, espically when I can combine them with my love for the outdoors. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I hope to use the knowledge I gain from coding to either start my own business, or help others see their ideas come to life. I am always brainstorming with friends or coworkers about ideas that I could develop. I am excited to become a part of the coding comunity, and know I will be able to bring a lot to the table.
